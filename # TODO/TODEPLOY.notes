Great question! Since your web app runs with `node server.js` and uses `npm run dev`, it sounds like you're using a Node.js server (likely with something like Express or Next.js). GitHub Pages **doesn't support Node.js servers**, as it only hosts static files (HTML, CSS, JS).

So, here's how you can **showcase your Node.js app** and **update your GitHub repo properly**:

---

### ✅ Step 1: Push Your App to GitHub

Make sure your app is version-controlled with Git:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Deploy Your App (since GitHub Pages won't work)

Use a platform that supports Node.js, such as:

#### 1. **Render** (free, easy, supports Node.js):

* Go to [https://render.com](https://render.com)
* Click **"New + > Web Service"**
* Connect your GitHub repo
* Use `npm install` as build command, and `node server.js` or `npm run dev` as start command (depending on how your app works)
* Set environment variables if needed (e.g., `NODE_ENV`)

#### 2. **Vercel** (best for Next.js):

* Go to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
* Import your GitHub repo
* Automatically detects Next.js and deploys it

#### 3. **Railway**, **Glitch**, **Cyclic**, or **Heroku** (alternative platforms)

---

### ✅ Step 3: Update GitHub README to Showcase

In your GitHub repo, update the `README.md` to include:

````markdown
# My Web App

A full-stack web application built with Node.js.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### ❌ Why GitHub Pages Doesn't Work Here

GitHub Pages only hosts **static files**, not servers. So `node server.js` won't work there because it needs a backend runtime environment.

---

### ✅ Alternative (if you just want to show a frontend)

If your app has both frontend and backend, and you just want to showcase the frontend:

1. Build your frontend (e.g., `npm run build`)
2. Copy the `build/` or `dist/` folder contents to a separate GitHub repo (or branch)
3. Use GitHub Pages to host that static frontend
